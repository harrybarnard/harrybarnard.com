support to all those people involved in young childrenâ€™s care, play and education.

  nationally.
* To develop partnerships and work co-operatively with people both employed and working voluntarily with children, in

## Why What We Do Is Important

We support individuals on the journey around equalities and inclusion. We help develop knowledge and skills that enable 
us to challenge and combat prejudice, discrimination and injustice in the lives of young children.

Early education holds the key to changing society and parents and carers are the prime educators in their children's 
lives.

We pro-actively encourage and develop an anti-bias approach to life by raising awareness and self-asteem in children 
and their adults.
