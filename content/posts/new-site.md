## Welcome

Bask in the newness.

I recently used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with my work for [ECP](/projects/ecpuk.org) and enjoyed my time with it greatly. 
I thought I'd give it a spin with my own site which I've been rather neglectful of recently. I've put together a custom 
Hugo skin and used a bunch of tech including the splendid [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com) front-end framework, 
[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and hosted it on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) 
Cloudfront.

You can find out more about how I put it together [here](/projects/harrybarnard.com).

## Projects

I'm currently going through my back catalogue of tech projects and intend to add them to my [portfolio](/projects) here 
and [GitHub](https://github.com/harrybarnard) as appropriate over the coming weeks.
